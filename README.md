# 🛠️ SaaS / Hosting Support Issue Templates

This repository provides **standardized support request templates** for SaaS/Hosting environments.  
It includes both **customer-facing forms** and **internal handoff formats** to streamline communication between customers, support, and engineering teams.

---

## 📌 Purpose
When customers submit support requests, they often miss critical details that engineering needs to reproduce and resolve the issue.  
These templates ensure:
- Customers provide the **right information** upfront.  
- Support teams can **enrich tickets** before escalating to engineering.  
- Engineering receives a **complete, consistent issue report** every time.
